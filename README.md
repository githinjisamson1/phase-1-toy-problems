# Phase 1 Week 1 Toy Problems

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

This simple JavaScript program assigns grades for student marks based on user input. The user is prompted to enter a student's marks, which should range from 0 to 100, and the application then calculates the grade in the manner described below:

A: 80 to 100
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

The solution to this challenge is found in: `studentGradeDetector.js`

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

This simple JavaScript program calculates the number of demerit points a driver would accrue based on a car's speed. The program abides by the next guidelines:

It prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70 km/h.
It awards the driver one demerit point for every 5 km/h over the permitted speed (70 km/h) and prints the overall number of demerit points.
When a driver reaches 12 or more points, the computer prints "License suspended."

The solution to this challenge is found in: `speedDetector.js`
